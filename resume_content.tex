Founding member of the Simulation team. Grew the team from two engineers to eighty-five engineers over four years. The team developed tooling that allowed Aurora to move to a development workflow driven entirely by by simulation testing. As discussed by Aurora's CEO in the following public interviews (linked in margin).

\subsection{2016-2017 Head of Autopilot Simulation at Tesla}

Recruited to grow and develop the simulation efforts at Tesla, I grew the team from two engineers to seventeen over the first year. The team produced a number of simulation tools that helped accelerate development and contributed to the launch of the "Hardware 2.0" version of Autopilot. See links opposite.

\subsection{2008-2016 New frontiers research fellow, University of Southampton}

A research fellowship and lecturing role. Helped secure over five-and-a-half million (USD equivalent) funding from multiple government grants and industrial collaborations. Research focussed on simulation of traffic control and autonomous vehicles (see margin). Taught Thermodynamics and Computer programming courses.

\subsection{2005-2007 Machine learning and perception group Microsoft Research}
Developed a rocket flight simulator for unguided sounding rockets. Including modelling uncertainty in atmospheric data with a bespoke ML model described in the paper linked in the margin.
